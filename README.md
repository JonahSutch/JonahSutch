# Hi there, I'm Jonah 👋

I'm a **Computer Science graduate student at Oregon State University** with a passion for building scalable systems, crafting production-ready applications, and solving complex engineering problems. Currently seeking **Software Engineering internships** where I can apply strong fundamentals and contribute to high-impact projects.

## 🚀 What I'm About

I love working across the stack—from backend data pipelines to mobile UI/UX. Whether it's optimizing database queries, building predictive models, or refactoring component architectures, I'm driven by the challenge of making systems more efficient, reliable, and user-friendly.

## 💻 Technical Skills

**Languages:** Python • C++ • C# • JavaScript • TypeScript • Java • RISC-V Assembly

**Frameworks & Libraries:** React Native • Expo • NumPy • Pandas • Flask • Unity • Drizzle ORM • Zustand

**Tools & Platforms:** Git/GitHub • Docker • Linux • Node.js • SQLite • VS Code

**Core Competencies:** REST APIs • Unit Testing • Scalable Architecture • Data Structures & Algorithms • CI/CD Fundamentals

## 🔨 Featured Projects

### [Ephira](https://github.com/JonahSutch/Ephira) - Menstrual Cycle Tracking App
*React Native • Expo • TypeScript • SQLite • Drizzle ORM*

A production-ready mobile app focused on privacy and usability. I built the core cycle prediction algorithms, health insight visualizations, and daily logging features while optimizing the data persistence layer for scalability.

**Key Contributions:**
- Engineered SQLite + Drizzle ORM data layer with optimized queries and schema design
- Refactored component architecture and improved render performance using Zustand state management
- Enhanced UI/UX through structured user testing and iterative improvements
- Collaborated through Git workflows, PR reviews, and modular code practices

### English Premier League Predictor
*Python • NumPy • Pandas • Statsmodels*

A predictive modeling system that forecasts league standings using Poisson regression and Monte Carlo simulations. Built end-to-end data pipelines and evaluation tools to measure prediction accuracy.

**Technical Highlights:**
- Implemented Monte Carlo simulation engine processing 5,000+ season simulations
- Automated full data pipeline: ingestion → preprocessing → feature engineering → model training
- Optimized runtime through vectorization and efficient data structures
- Developed statistical evaluation framework for season-over-season accuracy analysis
